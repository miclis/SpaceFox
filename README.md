# SpaceFox
Simple shooter in Python3 32-bit using pygame (in 1 file due to course restrictions).

"""
This program is a space shooter game created using pygame library in Python3.
Player flies a spacship and tries to avoid getting hit by rocks. He can use
laser gun to smash enemies or simply outmaneuver them.
Ship's shields can last several hits, but the bigger the stone is the more
shield hit point player loses.
Moreover, pilot has 3 backup ships (extra lives). After last one is lost
the game is over.
Destroying rocks gives points, the point is to get highest score.
Keep in mind that the difficulty is changing. The longer a player is flying,
the bigger speed rocks have.
